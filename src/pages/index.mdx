## Overview

**Context-Snoopiest** is a proprietary agentic framework that represents a breakthrough in the automated adaptation of long-form narrative literature into visual media. 

While the industry struggles with the "Context Horizon" of Large Language Models, we have successfully architected and delivered a system that maintains rigorous **state maintenance**—tracking physical locations, emotional arcs, and inventory across novels exceeding 100,000 words.

This project serves as a showcase of our ability to solve the "Lost-in-the-Middle" phenomenon through a **Hierarchical Recursive Summarization Architecture**. We have transformed raw narrative text into a "living backbone" of state, enabling the generation of consistent, high-fidelity video segments that adhere to the internal logic of the source material.

### Key Innovations Delivered

*   **Stateful Memory**: Beyond RAG, we treat narratives as **State Machines**, ensuring continuity that spans thousands of scenes.
*   **CCMS (Character Consistency Maintenance System)**: Using Identity Anchors to prevent character drift—a common failure in AI video.
*   **Temporal-Semantic Chunking**: A proprietary algorithm that aligns textual pacing with cinematic timing (8-10 second beats).

## Technical Portfolio

The following documentation provides a deep dive into the architectural decisions that made this project a success:

*   **[System Architecture](/Context-Snoopiest/architecture)**: How we establish "Ground Truth" before generation.
*   **[Context Engine](/Context-Snoopiest/context-management)**: Our solution to the context decay problem.
*   **[Chunking Strategy](/Context-Snoopiest/chunking)**: The math behind the 8-second cinematic constraint.
*   **[Workflows](/Context-Snoopiest/workflows)**: The multi-agent pipeline from raw text to final directives.

Through Context-Snoopiest, we have demonstrated that AI can not only understand a story but act as its **Continuity Editor and Cinematographer**, delivering a coherent visual adaptation that respects the author's original vision.
